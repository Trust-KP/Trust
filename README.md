## Overview

This repository contains two related but distinct documents concerning trust under uncertainty:

1. **Trust Equilibrium Framework**  
   A formal, conditional framework modelling trust as a retrospective system variable.

2. **Trust Descriptive Framework**  
   A descriptive, non-normative framework outlining distinct modes of trust and their common confusions.

The documents are intended for inspection, critique, comparison, or rejection.  
They are not a product, proposal, or prescription.

## Document Roles

### 1. Trust Equilibrium Framework (Normative / Formal)

- Defines trust as a retrospective, ledger-based quantity
- Describes decay, accumulation, loss, and decision thresholds
- Explicitly non-moral and non-psychological
- Applicable to bounded systems operating under uncertainty, including simulations and agentic systems
- Released for record and reference only

This document is **formal** and **conditional**.  
All conclusions depend on stated assumptions.

Status: **Frozen (v0.1)**  
Further revisions, if any, will be released as separate versions.

---

### 2. Trust Descriptive Framework (Descriptive / Explanatory)

- Describes multiple, incompatible modes of trust
- Clarifies why trust failures often arise from category errors
- Provides linguistic and conceptual distinctions only
- Does not define models, metrics, governance rules, or optimisation criteria

This document is **descriptive**, not normative.  
It does not override or modify the Trust Equilibrium Framework.

---

## Scope

These frameworks address:
- Trust under uncertainty
- Systemic continuity and failure
- Interpretive and formal distinctions in trust usage

They do **not** address:
- Moral or ethical justification
- Psychological completeness
- Policy recommendations
- Empirical calibration
- Product design or implementation details

---

## Relationship Between Documents

The Trust Descriptive Framework provides interpretive clarity.  
The Trust Equilibrium Framework provides a formal model.

They operate in different epistemic categories and should not be collapsed.

## Use and Misuse

These frameworks may be cited, critiqued, or repurposed.  
They may also be misused.

No endorsement, authority, or correctness is implied by their publication.
