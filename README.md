## Overview

This repository contains two related but epistemically distinct frameworks concerning trust under conditions of uncertainty.

They are released as public records for inspection, critique, comparison, or rejection.

They are **not** a product, proposal, policy recommendation, or prescription.

## Frameworks

### 1. Trust Equilibrium Framework (Formal / Conditional)

A formal, conditional framework modelling trust as a retrospective system variable.

This framework:
- defines trust as a ledger-based, retrospective quantity  
- describes accumulation, decay, loss, and decision thresholds  
- is explicitly non-moral and non-psychological  
- is applicable to bounded systems operating under uncertainty, including simulations and agentic systems  

This document is **formal and conditional**.  
All conclusions depend explicitly on stated assumptions.

**Status:** Frozen (v0.1)  
Any future revisions, if released, will be published as separate versions.

### 2. Trust Descriptive Framework (Descriptive / Explanatory)

A descriptive, non-normative framework outlining distinct modes of trust and common category confusions.

This framework:
- describes multiple, incompatible modes of trust  
- clarifies why trust failures often arise from category errors  
- provides linguistic and conceptual distinctions only  

It does **not**:
- define models or metrics  
- prescribe governance or behaviour  
- propose optimisation criteria  

This document is **descriptive, not normative**.  
It does not override, revise, or modify the Trust Equilibrium Framework.

## Relationship Between Frameworks

The two frameworks occupy **different epistemic categories**.

- The *Descriptive Framework* provides interpretive and linguistic clarity.  
- The *Equilibrium Framework* provides a formal, conditional model.

They may be read independently and should not be collapsed into a single system.

---

## Scope

These frameworks address:
- trust under uncertainty  
- systemic continuity and failure  
- interpretive and formal distinctions in trust usage  

They do **not** address:
- moral or ethical justification  
- psychological completeness  
- policy recommendations  
- empirical calibration  
- product design or implementation details

## Use and Misuse

These frameworks may be cited, critiqued, discussed, or repurposed.

They may also be misused.

No endorsement, authority, correctness, or suitability for any purpose is implied by their publication.
